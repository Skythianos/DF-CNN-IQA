# DF-CNN-IQA: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment with Convolutional Neural Networks and Decision Fusion 
**Paper title**: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment with Convolutional Neural Networks and Decision Fusion <br/><br/>
**Abstract**: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) has always been a difficult research problem because digital images may suffer very diverse types of distortions and their contents are extremely various. Moreover, IQA is also a very hot topic in the research community since the number and role of digital images in everyday life is continuously growing. Recently, a huge amount of effort has been devoted to exploiting convolutional neural networks and other deep learning techniques for no-reference image quality assessment. Since deep learning relies on a massive amount of labeled data, utilizing pretrained networks has become very popular in the literature. In this study, we introduce a novel, deep learning-based NR-IQA architecture that relies on the decision fusion of multiple image quality scores coming from different types of convolutional neural networks. The main idea behind this scheme is that a diverse set of different types of networks is able to better characterize authentic image distortions than a single network. The experimental results show that our method can effectively estimate perceptual image quality on four large IQA benchmark databases containing either authentic or artificial distortions. These results are also confirmed in significance and cross database tests. <br/><br/>
